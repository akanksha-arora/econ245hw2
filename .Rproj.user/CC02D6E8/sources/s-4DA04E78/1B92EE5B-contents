#1. Setting up the data
#a.
setwd("C:/Users/sonab/Desktop/245M Data Wrangling/HW2")
airbnb <- read_csv("assign_2.csv")
airbnb <- tibble(airbnb)

#b.
view(airbnb)
colnames(airbnb)

#c.
airbnb <- rename(airbnb, neighborhood=neighbourhood)

#2. Piping practice and creating summary statistics.
#a.
neighborhoods <- airbnb %>% count(neighborhood)

#b.
neighborhoods <- filter(neighborhoods, !is.na(neighborhood)) %>% arrange(desc(n)) %>% head(n=20)

#c.
airbnb_top_neighborhoods <- filter(airbnb, neighborhood %in% neighborhoods$neighborhood)

#d.
summary_stats_top_neighborhoods <- airbnb_top_neighborhoods %>% group_by(neighborhood) %>% 
  summarise(avg_square_feet=mean(square_feet, na.rm=T), avg_price=mean(price, na.rm=T), sd_price=sd(price, na.rm=T), max_price=max(price, na.rm=T), min_price=min(price, na.rm=T)) %>% arrange(desc(avg_square_feet))
#No, only square footage does not account for higher listing price.

#e.
highest_avg_square_ft <- summary_stats_top_neighborhoods[1,2]
print(highest_avg_square_ft)

#f.
second_avg_price <- summary_stats_top_neighborhoods[2,2]
